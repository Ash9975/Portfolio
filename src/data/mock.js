  description: "I’m Ashish Pimpalshende, a final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in building real-world, user-focused web applications. I enjoy working across the full stack, from designing clean and intuitive interfaces to developing reliable backend logic.Over time, I’ve focused on learning by doing — building projects with React, Node.js, and modern web tools to strengthen both my technical foundation and problem-solving skills. I care a lot about how a product feels to use, which is why I pay close attention to UI, performance, and overall user experience. I’m continuously improving my skills through hands-on projects and exploring better ways to write clean, maintainable code. My goal is to grow as a developer who not only builds functional applications but also creates experiences that people enjoy using.",
